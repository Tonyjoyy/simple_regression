what is the function in numpy to combine two vectorï¼Ÿ

In NumPy, you can use several functions to combine two vectors, depending on how you want to combine them. Here are some common methods:

Using np.concatenate:
This function concatenates two or more arrays along a specified axis.

import numpy as np

vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
combined = np.concatenate((vector1, vector2))
print(combined)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
Using np.vstack:
This function stacks arrays in sequence vertically (row-wise).

combined = np.vstack((vector1, vector2))
print(combined)
# Output:
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]
Using np.hstack:
This function stacks arrays in sequence horizontally (column-wise).

combined = np.hstack((vector1, vector2))
print(combined)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
Using np.stack:
This function stacks arrays along a new axis.

combined = np.stack((vector1, vector2), axis=0)  # Stack along the first axis
print(combined)
# Output:
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]
Choose the method that best fits your needs based on how you want to combine the vectors!
